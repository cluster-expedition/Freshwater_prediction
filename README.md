## Machine Learning tool to predict the quality of freshwater
The project is based on one of the themes Intel® oneAPI Hackathon for Open Innovation

### Machine Learning Challenge Track: Predict the quality of freshwater

#### Problem:
Freshwater is one of our most vital and scarce natural resources, making up just 3% of the earth’s total water volume. It touches nearly every aspect of our daily lives, from drinking, swimming, and bathing to generating food, electricity, and the products we use every day. Access to a safe and sanitary water supply is essential not only to human life, but also to the survival of surrounding ecosystems that are experiencing the effects of droughts, pollution, and rising temperatures.

#### Expected Solution:
In this track of the hackathon, we apply Machine learning concepts and leverage oneAPI capabilities to help global water security and environmental sustainability efforts by predicting whether freshwater is safe to drink and use for the ecosystems that rely on it
